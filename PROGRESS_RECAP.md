# Project Recap

Here’s a high-level summary of everything we’ve accomplished so far—and where we stand:

## 🚀 Phase 0: Front-End & Project Setup
- **UI Clone:** Built a pixel-perfect Next.js front-end matching Nunflix’s homepage, detail pages, search, watch, etc.
- **Theming & UX:** Fixed UI bugs, added dark mode, responsive grid cards, filter bars.
- **Repo & Environment:** Initialized a private GitHub repo, wired up .env for Supabase, TMDB, Sentry, etc.

## 🔐 Phase 1: Data Security & Schema
- **Supabase Schema:** Created tables for titles, episodes, favorites, watchlist, progress, plus caching tables (list_cache, media_cache).
- **Auth:** Enabled Supabase Auth and tested sign-up/sign-in.
- **Row-Level Security:** Locked down favorites, watchlist, progress so users can only read/write their own rows.

## 🎥 Phase 2: Stream Resolver (P1)
- **API Route:** Added pages/api/stream/[id].ts in Next.js.
- **Embed Discovery:** Loop through providers (Vidsrc, MultiEmbed), HEAD-check each URL, return a stream_sources[] array.
- **Watch Page:** Updated /watch/[id] to fetch stream_sources and load the first working embed in the iframe.

## 🛠 Phase 3: API Façade (P2)
- **Frontpage:** Created /api/v1/frontpage, pulling from Supabase’s list_cache and falling back to TMDB when needed.
- **Title Details:** Built /api/v1/title/[id], merging cached TMDB metadata, credits, videos, and stream_sources.
- **Search:** Exposed /api/v1/search wrapping TMDB’s multi-search.
- **Discover:** Completed the Discover feature with a dedicated, cached API for genres and a fully functional UI with filters and infinite scroll.

## 🛡 Phase 4: Ops & Hygiene (P3)
- **Scheduled Cache Refresh:** Deployed a Supabase Scheduled Function that refreshes your caches every 6 h, with backoff and freshness timestamps.
- **Error Monitoring:** Integrated Sentry (client + server), uploaded source maps, set up high-severity alerts.
- **Rate Limiting:** Added token-bucket middleware on all /api/v1/* routes, returning 429 + Retry-After when limits are exceeded.

## 🛡️ Phase 5: DMCA Resilience
- **`embed_providers` Table:** Created a new Supabase table to dynamically manage stream providers, complete with a seeding migration and RLS policy.
- **Randomized Stream Resolver:** Updated the `/api/stream/[id]` route to fetch active providers from the database, shuffle them, and probe for working links.
- **Provider Health-Check Job:** Deployed a scheduled Supabase function to automatically check provider status and disable dead links.

## 🚀 Phase 6: CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions:** Created a CI/CD workflow that lints and builds on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

## 🎯 What’s Next
- **(Completed)** Finish Discover: Complete /api/v1/discover caching logic and build the Discover page with genre/sort filters + infinite scroll.
- **(Completed)** DMCA Resilience: Implement mirror rotation, health checks, and optional fallback scraping to keep your embeds alive.
- **(Completed)** CI/CD: Create a workflow that lints/tests on PRs and auto-deploys main.
- (Skipped for now) Admin Tools: On-demand dashboards for cache purges and stream-source management.
- **User Profiles:** Add user profiles.
