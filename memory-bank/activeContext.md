# Active Context

This document captures the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and important decisions for the Nunflix project.

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on post-launch monitoring and maintenance.

## Recent Changes

*   **Pre-Launch Readiness Review:** Completed all tasks identified in the pre-launch readiness review.
    *   **Security Enhancements:**
        *   Enabled RLS for the `user_settings` table.
        *   Added HTTP security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`).
    *   **CI/CD & Deployment Improvements:**
        *   Added database migration and Vercel deployment steps to the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Feature Implementation:**
        *   Implemented pagination for the search page.
        *   Implemented metadata strip actions on the watch page.
    *   **SEO & Analytics:**
        *   Created `robots.txt` and a dynamic `sitemap.xml`.
    *   **Performance Optimizations:**
        *   Improved user-facing error messages with a custom error page.
        *   Implemented lazy loading for carousels.

## Next Steps

1.  Monitor the application for any issues that may arise post-launch.
2.  Address any bugs or performance issues that are identified.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

*   Next.js for frontend development.
*   Supabase for backend and database.
*   Component-based architecture.
*   CSS Modules for styling.
*   Dynamic routing for content categories.
*   TMDB integration for content data.
*   Caching for API responses.
*   GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
*   Zustand for state management.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project uses a hybrid approach for the backend with Supabase Edge Functions and Next.js API routes.
*   There's a clear focus on improving resilience and automation.
*   Dynamic routing and API enhancements are crucial for scalability.
*   Careful management of Next.js data fetching (e.g., `getStaticProps`) is essential to avoid runtime errors and ensure reliable data loading.
*   Debugging frontend rendering issues (hydration errors, image loading) requires inspecting both browser console logs and server-side terminal output.
*   Directly downloading external assets can be problematic due to hotlinking restrictions; using reliable CDN paths (like TMDB's) is often more robust.
