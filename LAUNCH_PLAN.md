# Nunflix Launch Plan

This document outlines the steps to launch the Nunflix application.

## 1. Final Deployment

The final deployment will be triggered by merging the `main` branch into a new `release` branch. This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the latest version of the application to Vercel.

## 2. Post-Launch Monitoring

After deployment, the application will be monitored for any errors or issues. Sentry will be used to track any errors that occur in the application.

## 3. Announce Launch

Once the application is stable, the launch will be announced to the public.
